# ‚ôæÔ∏è Potentiometer

- This project involves the development of a basic prototype using an Arduino board, a potentiometer, and LEDs. The main goal is to demonstrate how analog input from a potentiometer can be used to control the brightness of one or more LEDs.

## üí° Modules Overview 

- Tinkercad
- C++
- Arduino IDE (optional)

## üß© Components

- Arduino Board: The Arduino board is the central microcontroller used in this project. It serves as the brain of the system, reading inputs (like from the potentiometer or button) and controlling outputs (such as the LEDs). It can be programmed using the Arduino IDE with simple C/C++-based code.
- LEDs: LEDs are used as visual indicators in the circuit. In this project, they light up or change brightness based on the input from the potentiometer or the state of the button. LEDs are polarized components, meaning they have a positive (anode) and a negative (cathode) side.
- Button: The button allows for digital input into the Arduino. When pressed, it completes a circuit and sends a HIGH signal (typically 5V) to a digital input pin. It can be used to trigger actions such as turning LEDs on or off.
- Potentiometer: A potentiometer is a variable resistor that allows you to adjust resistance manually by rotating a knob. It sends an analog signal to the Arduino, which can be used to control variables like LED brightness. The value ranges from 0 to 1023.
- Resistors: Resistors are used to limit the current in the circuit, protecting components like LEDs from receiving too much current and burning out. They are essential for managing safe current levels, especially when working with delicate components.
- Wires: Wires connect all the components together on a breadboard and link them to the Arduino board. They come in male-to-male, male-to-female, or female-to-female types and are essential for creating flexible and reusable circuits.
